One of the many heralds of geekdom is an extremely customized
environment. This is the history of our journey down that path.

We use vim and [Z-Shell](http://www.zsh.org/) as our primary tools for getting things
done. We track my code with [Git](http://git-scm.com/).  Much of that code is 
written in [Python](http://www.python.org/) and [NodeJS](http://www.nodejs.org).

Our many thanks to the wonderful [Nick Meharry](https://github.com/nickmeharry/dotfiles/),
whose wonderful dotfiles was a guide.
